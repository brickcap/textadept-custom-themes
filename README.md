#Directions

1. Clone the repository
2. Extract the theme into the textadept/themes directory
3. Select the theme from view->select theme or ctrl+shift+t

#How to edit the theme

Every theme in *textadept* consits of three files

1. buffer.lua
2. lexer.lua
3. view.lua

lexer.lua is the one that contains the styles that will be used by the lexer in *textadept*
